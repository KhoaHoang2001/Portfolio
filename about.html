        <h1>A little about me</h1>
        <p>I'm an aspired software developer from Vietnam, currently in my 4th year at Saigon University. I was first introduced coding in 6th grade when I was introduced to my first programming language, Pascal. Since then, my passion for coding has only grown stronger.<br/>
        During my time at Saigon University, I've actively pursued personal projects to enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of software development. These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge in practical ways and have given me valuable hands-on experience.<br/>
        Right now I am currently studying Mechanical and Sustainable Engineering in Arcada University of Applied Science.<br/>
        I believe in continuously pushing my boundaries and staying up to date with the latest trends. I actively seek out opportunities to expand my skill set and explore new technologies. My dedication to lifelong learning has helped me stay adaptable and open to new challenges.<br/></p>
